1. CLICK source code
---------------
Get the click source from here: https://github.com/kohler/click/archive/master.zip

unpack the file. 

This package provides two files that implement our QoS algorithm: aaqm.cc and aaqm.hh. 
When compiled with click, they add a new element AAQM to the click's package. 
	

2. How to compile
------------------
To add a new element click does not require to change it's existing make file. 

To add the element aaqm to a click package, copy the files aaqm.cc and aaqm.hh to click-master/elements/aqm/.

Configure click to compile as a kernel module. 

#./configure --enable-linuxmodule. 

Add AAQM to elements list. 

#make elemlist

Compile and Install 

#make install 

3. How to run
-------------

Use the click configuration file aaqm.click to test AAQM element. 

To load the click module. 
#click-install aaqm.click

To unload the click module
#click-uninstall

4. Getting packet statistics
----------------------------
AAQM has handlers that specifies the number of packets dropped and current queue size for each queue. 

Ex: To get the packet drops for Queue1 
Using the aaqm.click
#cat /click/aaqm/drops1

The stats.sh script can be used to monitor the packet statistics continuously. 
(Note: the stats.sh script is written specifically for the click configuration aaqm.click)

Ex: 
#sh stats.sh 
Packet statistics
	
queue input count drop output
queue1 	0 	0 	0 	0
queue2 	0 	0 	0 	0
queue3 	0 	0 	0 	0
queue4 	0 	0 	0 	0
queue5 	0 	0 	0 	0
 Output rate: 0 pkts/sec
 Output rate: 0 bits/sec

The stats are also logged into a file called log.
